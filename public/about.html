<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Junior developer with little experience but a lot of knowledge and eager to grow in the world of programming.</p>

<p>I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the National Experimental University of Tachira.</p>

<p>My experience currently is mainly in the field of customer service and sales via call center or directly in person with the client, but I have always wanted to be able to finish my degree and before that start in the tech world to be able to evolve in a great way.</p>
